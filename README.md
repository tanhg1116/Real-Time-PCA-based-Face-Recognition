# Undergraduate-Y3S3-PCA-based-Face-Recognition
Author: Ng Zheng Jue, Heng Chia Ying, Tan Hong Guan, Ng Rui Qi

* This is a project developed in undergraduate Year 3 - Semester 3
* This repository consists of code to perform real-time face recognition based on the dataset given in the 'Face_Image' directory.
* This repository consists of
  * 1 Jupyter Notebook file [PCA_based_Face_Recognition.ipynb](https://github.com/xinjue37/Undergraduate-Y3S3-PCA-based-Face-Recognition/blob/main/PCA_based_Face_Recognition.ipynb) that consists of overall experimental design, development of method including training and evaluating the classifier and lastly the real-time face recognition system build.
  * [Face_Image](https://github.com/xinjue37/Undergraduate-Y3S3-PCA-based-Face-Recognition/tree/main/Face_Image) folder to store the face image for recognition
  * Library required to run the code
```
!pip install -U scikit-learn
!pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
!pip install xgboost catboost lightgbm
```
